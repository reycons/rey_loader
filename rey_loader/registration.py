"""What this application tells bootstrap about itself.

Discovery identity, and deliberately nothing else. Installing the distribution
is what makes the application visible; this says which application was found.

**Not capability.** Commands and workflow operations are published in a later
increment. Duplicating the CLI catalog here would migrate capability into the
increment that exists to defer it, and the registry would briefly be the source
of truth twice.

**Not configuration.** Where the application is checked out, whether this
installation enables it, and where it logs are the installation's answers, held
in ``install/apps/<app>.yaml``. A registration that carried them would let a
package decide something about an installation it has never seen.
