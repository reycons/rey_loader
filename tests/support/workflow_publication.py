"""Preparing a workflow fixture for the published-contract coordinator.

A process binds a name to an operation its application publishes, and the
coordinator validates a step's configuration against that publication before
dispatching. A fixture written before that contract existed declares neither,
so this supplies both from what the fixture already says.

It publishes exactly what the workflow uses, which is the weakest publication
under which the fixture is legal: a test still proves what it was written to
prove, and nothing is accidentally allowed through.
